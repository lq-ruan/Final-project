# Final-project
DressedByTheDay

The project developed is Comfort Temperature Dress Assistant, which helps users select the most appropriate clothing based on the difference between the current ‘feels-like’ temperature and their personal comfort temperature.

The main features include:
Assigning a warmth value to each piece of clothing
Accepting user input for temperature, wind condition, rainy condition, and ideal comfort temperature (with a default value of 25°C)
Calculating the required warmth
Recommending clothing combinations accordingly

Factors considered include the daily temperature, the user’s comfort preference, and whether it is a windy day.
