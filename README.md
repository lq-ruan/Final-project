# Final-project

The project developed is Dressed by the day, which helps users select the most appropriate clothing based on the difference between the current ‘feels-like’ temperature and their personal comfort temperature.

Factors considered:Daily temperature; The user’s comfort preference; Windy Condition; Rainy Condition


How the project works:
The program begins by prompting the user to enter the current temperature, as well as whether it is windy or rainy. It then calculates a “feels-like” temperature based on these factors. The user is also asked to specify their personal comfort temperature (or use a default of 26°C).

Based on the temperature gap, the program generates and evaluates all 1–3 item clothing combinations from a predefined wardrobe (each with warmth values and emoji). It selects the best-fitting outfit and displays it with a friendly scene description (e.g., "Picture this: it's a cool and breezy day...").

If it’s raining, it gently reminds the user to bring an umbrella. The result includes total warmth and a soft message for the day.
